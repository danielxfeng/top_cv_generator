# CV Generator App

This is a simple **CV Generator** web application built with **React**. It allows users to generate a CV based on a form input, with a live preview of the CV as it's being edited. The project was created as a practice exercise for **The Odin Project**.

## Live Demo

The application is deployed on Netlify. You can access the live version of the app here:

## Features

- Users can input personal information, education, and work experiences through a form.
- A live preview of the CV is generated as the user fills in the form.
- **No persistent storage**: The data is not saved, and will be reset if the page is refreshed.
  
## Technologies Used

- **React**: The application is built using React for the UI.
- **Vite**: The project is set up and bundled using **Vite**, known for its fast development and build process.
- **Netlify**: The app is deployed on **Netlify**, which also handles automatic **CI/CD** for deployment updates.

## Limitations

- **No data persistence**: Currently, there is no backend or local storage setup, so any data entered will be lost on page refresh.
- The CV preview is generated based on the form inputs, but there are no additional customization features (e.g., changing the style or layout of the CV).

## About

This project was developed as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum, focusing on React and front-end development skills.
